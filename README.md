# Sheep Breed Classification with CNNs

This project applies to transfer learning to a small dataset of 4 breeds of sheep that are local to Saudi Arabia. The objective is 
to accurately calssify the breed of sheep. 

We use Keras and a pretrained ResNet50 model to build our new network. In addition, we use Keras' Image Data Generation to perform data 
augmentation to enhance the performance of the network.
